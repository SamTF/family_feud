# Family Feud for Discord!
**Steve Harvey** is a Discord bot that allows you to play the hit game show *"Family Feud"* on Discord!

# Instructions

 1. Start a new game with `/feud`. Optionally specify how many questions the game should have, otherwise it's random.
 
 2. Try guessing the answers with `/guess <string>`. Use single word guesses for best chances at matching with a correct answer.
 
 3. Use `/board` to view the current state of the board: which answers have been gotten and which ones are missing.

---

The game is over once you have guessed all answers, or after submitting 3 wrong guesses. 
Have fun!
